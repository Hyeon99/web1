  <h2>HISTORY OF CHEMISTRY</h2>
  <p><strong>Chemistry</strong> is a branch of <u>science</u> that deals with the study of matter.
  Chemists are interested in the property of the different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table" target="_blank"
  title="periodic table">elements</a>
  and the ways in which they interact with each other, and react to energy.
  Chemistry has been around for a long time. In fact, the study of chemistry is known to date back
  as far as prehistoric times.<img style="margin-top:10px;" src="chemistry1.jpg" width="300"></p>
  <p style="margin-top:30px;">The earliest record of man's interest in chemistry dates back to 3000 BC.
  During this time, chemistry was considered an art more than a science. Chemistry evolved from practical
  knowledge such as metallurgy, pottery, and dyeing.</p>
  <p style="margin-top:30px;">Ancient Egyptians produced many interesting new products, such as the ones used for
  mummification. These were developed with consdierable skill and no understanding of the principles involved.</p>
