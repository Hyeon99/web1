  <h2>CHEMICAL EQUATIONS</h2>
  <p>Reactions are identified by a change in a material or a system. In chemistry, there are two types of changes-the physical change
  and the chemical change. Physical changes refer to changes in energy and states of matter.</p>
  <p>For example, a cup changes its shape when someone steps on it. The chape of the object is changed but no new substances are formed.
  When an ice cube melts, it becomes liquid water. There is a change in state(from solid to liquid) but it is still the same substance.
  Chemical change, on the other hand, is a change that happens on a molecular level.</p>
  <p>A chemical change alters the elemental composition of the original matter and produces new substances. Equations are used to
  describe both physical and chemical reactions.</p>
