  <h2>MOLECULAR MASS</h2>
  <P>There are different terms designating particular aspects of molecular mass.
  It is important to understand these terms in dorder to fully understand the definition of molecular mass. Relative isotopic Mass
  is the mass of the isotope relative to 1/12 of the mass of a carbon-12 atom. Isotopes are atoms of the same element having the same
  number of protons and electrons but with different masses due to the difference in the number of neutrons.</P>
  <p>Atoms are not visible to the naked eye thus it is impossible to measure the mass of an atom using standard units like grams or
  milligrams. Insteads, masses are measured on a scale based on the mass of an atom of the 12C isotope. One the 12C scale, the 12C Isotope
  is given a mass of exactly 12 units, and the masses of all other isotopes are measured on the same scale.</p>
  <p>Atomic Mass refers to the mass of a specific isotope and is expressed in u(unified atomic mass unit) or Da(Dalton). The Average Mass
  is the average weight of the isotopic masses weighted by the isotopic abundances. The average mass can be calculated using the atomic
  weights of the elements.
